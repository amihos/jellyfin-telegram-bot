# Series Muting/Blocking System - Raw Idea

## Feature Description

Allow users to opt-out of notifications for specific TV series they're not interested in. When a user receives a notification about a series episode, they should be able to tell the bot "I don't want to follow this series" so they stop receiving future notifications for new episodes of that series.

This is a user preference system focused on content filtering at the series level.
