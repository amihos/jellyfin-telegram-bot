# Raw Idea: Interactive UI/UX Enhancement

## Feature Description

Enhance the bot's user experience by adding interactive buttons and menus to make it easier to use. Current state: Users must type commands like /start, /recent, /search, /mutedlist. Proposed improvements include:

1. Inline keyboard buttons for main navigation (welcome menu with buttons)
2. Menu button integration (Telegram's native menu button feature)
3. Enhanced welcome/start message with inline buttons
4. Possibly add action buttons to content items

The goal is to make the bot more intuitive and user-friendly by reducing the need to remember and type commands, while maintaining a clean interface.

## Project Context

- Go-based Telegram bot using github.com/go-telegram/bot library
- Already has working commands and inline buttons for mute/unmute features
- Production bot with active users
- Persian (Farsi) UI language
